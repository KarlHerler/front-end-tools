        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I have collected some of the front-end development tools that I use on a regular basis. This list is still a work in progress and I would love any contributions to it. At the moment if you want to contribute just head over to <a href="https://github.com/KarlHerler/front-end-tools/">github</a> where you will find the entire source for this project.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="javascript">
        <h2>Frameworks - javascript</h2>
        <p>This section holds larger tools that have an impact on several parts of your project.</p>

        <div class="tool" id="jquery">
          <div class="img"><img src="img/jquery.png" alt="jquery" /> </div>
          <aside>
            <h3><a href="http://jquery.com/" class="external">jQuery</a></h3>
            <p>jQuery is a must have javascript framework. If you don't use jQuery yet then you should stop reading right now and take a week off to learn it, seriously, I'll still be arround when you come back.</p>
          </aside>
        </div>
        <div class="tool" id="CoffeeScript">
          <div class="img"><img src="img/coffeescript.png" alt="coffeescript" /></div>
          <aside>
            <h3><a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" class="external">CoffeeScript</a></h3>
            <p>CoffeeScript is a fairly new but very much appriciated addition to my stack. CoffeeScript is a language which adds a few small things to javascript that do wonders for the beauty and fun of the language. The only downside with it is that you want to compile CoffeeScript, which requires node.js and knowing what the word "compile" means.</p>
          </aside>
        </div>

        <div class="tool" id="Backbonejs">
          <div class="img"><img src="img/backbone.png" alt="backbone" /></div>
          <aside>
            <h3><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/" class="external">Backbone.js</a></h3>
            <p>Backbone.js is also a fairly new addition to my stack. Backbone provides a Model-View-Controller (or Model-View-Collection as they call it) architecture to your webapp. Backbone also easies your communication to the server and provides you with a solid way of declaring your datastructures.</p> 
            <p>Backbone isn't a tool that you will need on all your projects but if you are heading into (or are in) a web app project you really want to use backbone.</p>

      <section id="visual">
        <h2>Frameworks - Visual</h2>
        <p>These frameworks vary in their roles, from just prepering the a canvas for you to work on, to providing build tools and documentation.<p>

        <div class="tool" id="html5boilerplate">

            <p>Html5boilerplate is so much more than just a boilerplate, it is all you need to have to get a solid start to any project.</p>
          </aside>
        </div>

        <div class="tool" id="bootstrap">
          <div class="img"><img src="img/bootstrap.png" alt="bootstrap" /></div>
          <aside>
            <h3><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#popovers" class="external">Bootstrap</a></h3>
            <p>Twitter recently launched a visual framework called "bootstrap", it is fairly lightweight, at the moment it might even be a bit too lightweight. It is the visualframework that powers most of this thing that you are looking at right now, albiet with some tweaks.</p>
          </aside>
        </div>

        <div class="tool" id="blueprint">

          <aside>
            <h3><a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" class="external">Blueprint</a></h3>
            <p>Blueprint is the mother of all css frameworks, it has everything you would need to start working on a site. It is a great tool for you if you aren't all that familiar with css and just want something that looks good out of the box.</p>
          </aside>
        </div>

        <div class="tool" id="skeleton">

            <p>jQuery UI is a complement to jQuery which offers User Interface components for most of your needs. I'll mention some specific components in other sections because they are good enough to stand on their own.</p>
            <p>If tou want to spice jQuery UI up a bit I recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://taitems.github.com/Aristo-jQuery-UI-Theme/" class="external"> Aristo theme for jQuery UI</a> which is a theme designed for the cappucino framework by sofa. </p>

      <section id="layouts">
        <h2>Layouts &amp; Grids</h2>
        <p>While I personally do not like grid systems I am often forced to work with them and many people like them so they do deserve a mention here. One should also notice that both bootstrap and blueprint provides a grid for usage so if you're swinging with those then you might aswell use that (unless you need a specific size).</p>

        <div class="tool" id="960">
          <div class="img" style="background: #123;"><img src="img/960.gif" alt="960" /></div><!-- YES! I just did that!-->

            <h3><a href="http://960.gs/" class="external">960.gs</a></h3>
            <p>960.gs is the classic grid system, spanning 960 pixels and avaliable in 12 or 16 columns flavors. It is still very popular, if not the most poplular grid system.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Typography is a bit of a obession of mine so this section might get a bit nerdy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/" class="external">Google webfonts</a></h3>
            <p>Google has been hard at work on making font embedding as easy as possible. Google webfonts is the culmination of all that work. It is arguably the best font embedding service if you do not need big name typefaces, because google webfonts is limited to free or open source typefaces.</p>

            <p>TypeKit was one of innovators in this field and they still have a very good service. If your typeface needs are more on modern typefaces and especially if you need Adobe&tm; typefaces then this is the service for you.</p>

            <p>If you need to get big name typefaces on your site then this is the service I would recommend, although it has the worlds slowest admin site.</p>

      <section id="alerts">
        <h2>Alerts &amp; Modal overlays</h2>
        <p>Modal overlay is a umbrella term for things like lightboxes, popovers and any type of element which pops up infront of the content to promt the user to react. They are often used for displaying enlarged images but can be used for most things that need to interrupt the users workflow and be annoying. This section also has some (a) alert tool which although it is a modal overlay it doesn't do anything other than work as a notification or a dialog. </p>
        <!--<p>The usual <code>alert('somethingrather')</code> dialog has long been a nuicence of front-end and people and does not provide a way of informing the user of something non-critical without interrupting her/his workflow.</p>-->

        <p> There are also a few modal dialogs avaliable in the <a href="http://me/~kalle/frontend-tools/#html5boilerplate">bootstrap framework</a> which was mentioned earlier.
        
         <div class="tool" id="smokejs">

          <p>Smoke.js a pretty little script package with several types of alerts. It is also framework agnostic and packaged to be self supporting. Smoke uses all kinds of html5 and css3 buzzwordtastic goodies to make it fast and easy to work with.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" class="external">lightbox 2</a></h3>
          <p>A Lightbox is a type of modal overlay designed to overlay images over the current page. You have probably seen a lightbox already, if not then head over to the site to try one out. Lightbox uses the protype framework to help this</p>

          <aside>
          <h3><a href="http://fancybox.net/" class="external">fancybox</a></h3>
          <p>Fancybox is a newer variant of lightbox, it features more good stuff and is generally better. Fancybox is also designed to work with things other than images so if you are planning on using modal overlays to display other things then this is the one I'd recommend, although I would recommend it over lightbox for images as well.</p>

          <p>Zurb has in one of their experiments made a set of pretty nice modal dialogs. While these modal dialogs aren't packaged in a neat package that you can just drop into your project they are still very much worth a look. You should note that they use css3 quite heavily and might not be suitable for all of your projects.</p>

      <section id="charting">
        <h2>Charting &amp; Graphs</h2>
        <p>Doing charts and datavisualizations is another of my <a href="http://mighty.no-de/">hobbies</a>. <br> Generally speaking there are three ways to go about making graphs:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics (svg) -tools.</strong> My favorite method because svg:s are very flexible, fast and easy to work with, but their biggest flaw is that older browsers might not support svg or they might support it only partially</li>
          <li><strong>Flash -tools.</strong> Flash tools are the older way of making charts and is still quite popular due too the market penetration of flash and support for older browsers (just as long as they have flash installed). If you plan on supporting anything with an "i" as the first letter of it's name and an apple on the back then this tool is unfortunately out of the window, also flash sucks.</li>
          <li><strong>Server-side pre-render.</strong> This method uses a little help from a server to create the charts and then sends them to front-end as an image. I wont go into so many of these because they aren't strictly front-end tools but there's a plethora of tools depending on what kind of server environment you use, there's also some hosted tools that do it for you.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tool" id="highcharts">
          <div class="img"><img src="img/highcharts.png" alt="highcharts" /></div>
          <aside>
          <h3><a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" class="external">Highcharts</a></h3>
          <p>Highcharts is a tool that fits into the first category. It is free for non-commercial projects but requires a licencing fee for commercial ones, which is the only tool in this list that does so. I would still recommend it over the free alternatives because it is just so much better. It is the tool that I use on <a href="http://mighty.no.de/">mighty.no.de</a> and <a href="http://mixpanel.com">mixpanel</a> uses for their charting.</p>

          <aside>
          <h3><a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/" class="external">g.raphaël</a></h3>
          <p>g.raphaël is the graphing library for a vector graphics tool called Raphaël. It also fits into the first category, being a svg generating tool. It was my first choice of tool since it is open source &amp; free but the it was too impractical for my needs, you should go ahead and try it out before jumping to another tool though.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/" class="external">Open Flash Chart 2</a></h3>
          <p>Open Flash Chart is, as hinted by its name, a flash based tool. It is also open source and free, but development on it is rather stagnated. If you want a flash based tool that is rather more...flashy then I would recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.fusioncharts.com/" id="fusion-charts">FusionCharts</a> which is a commercial flash based charting tool.</p>

          <h3><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart" class="external">Google charts</a></h3>
          <p>Google chart tools are a bit of all the things, they offer a variety of charts some svg based, some flash and some server served images. They are still very good and flexible, but require you to do all your rendering via googles servers. Although they are unlikely to go down but rendering them yourself might be faster and you have more control over the process.</p>
